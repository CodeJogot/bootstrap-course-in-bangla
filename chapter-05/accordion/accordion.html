                This is the first item's accordion body. It is shown by default,
                until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use
                to style each element. These classes control the overall
                appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions.
                You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our
                default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
                can go within the .accordion-body, though the transition does
                limit overflow.
